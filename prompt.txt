	- Goals: 
		- The main goal is two create two dashboards or reports from on-chain testnet data for 
			§ 1. new testnet accounts created since the last testnet reset 
			§ 2. active testnet accounts: this should should accounts that have more than two transactions per month while enabling deeper dives into transaction details (aggreggate txs by service and date)
		- The information retrieval, analysis, and reporting are to be automated via a weekly cron job. The dashboard should be persisten. 
		- The automation should consist of an initial data pull that pull historical data since 2024-02-01 up until  the moment od the initial pull. 
		- Then subsequent data pulls should only pull data since the last pull and add it to the database, analysis, and reporting.
	- 
	- Data Retrieval
		- Initial Execution: This is the first retrieval, analysis, and reporting of the information. 
			§ Obtaining Testnet Accounts Created Since the last testnet reset:
				□ At this moment data should be retrieved from 2024-02-01 to the moment of execution (2025)
				□ The queries are executed and the key information is written to a database (or file)
				□ Key information to write to database:
					® History and details of Account Create Transactions
				□ The last consensus timestamp in the data retrieve is highly relevant. Subsequent data pulls are to be done for timestamps greater than this last one.
			§ Obtaining transaction history for all of the accounts created since the last testnet reset
				□ This should be a single list of transactions for all the account ids in the previous query. The list of accounts should be passed as a variable to the relevant query
				□ Key information to write to new table in the database (or file):
					® History and details of the transactions submitted by all account ids created since the last testnet reset
				
		- Subsequent executions:
			§ These data pulls should be done for consensus timestamps greater than the most recent timestamp in the previous execution that obtains the testnet accounts created
			§ New data retrieved should be appended to the existing databases
				□ New testnet accounts created
Transactions by all accounts in the database after the last execution
